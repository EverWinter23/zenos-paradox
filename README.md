## zenos-paradox

“So Zeno is most famous for his tortoise paradox. Let us imagine that you are in
a race with a tortoise. The tortoise has a ten-yard head start. In the time it
takes you to run that ten yards, the tortoise has maybe moved one yard. And then
in the time it takes you to make up that distance, the tortoise goes a bit farther,
and so on forever. You are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him;
you can only decrease his lead.

“Of course, you just run past the tortoise without contemplating the mechanics
involved, but the question of how you are able to do this turns out to be incredibly
complicated, and no one really solved it until Cantor showed us that some infinities
are bigger than other infinities.”
